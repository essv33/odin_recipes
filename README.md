# odin_recipes

Odin Recipes is my first attempt writing html boilerplate from scratch. I learned some basic skills in the following during this section of foundations course:
-Running command from the Konsole in my Kubuntu OS
-Installing Vim, Virtual Code Studio from the command line interface (CLI)
-Basic command prompts
-Writing optional shortcuts into my CLI
-Installing and setting up git from my CLI
-Writing and testing basic HTML elements

This is my first project and was extremely helpful in identifying things I can improve. I was happy with how few mistakes I had writing from memory and I'm eager to continue improving.
