# odin_recipes

<strong>Odin Recipes</strong> is my first attempt writing html boilerplate from scratch. I learned some basic skills in the following during this section of foundations course:
<ul>
<li>Running command from the Konsole in my Kubuntu OS</li>
<li>Installing Vim, Virtual Code Studio from the command line interface (CLI)</li>
<li>Basic command prompts</li>
<li>Writing optional shortcuts into my CLI</li>
<li>Installing and setting up git from my CLI</li>
<li>Writing and testing basic HTML elements</li>
</ul>
<br>
This is my first project and was extremely helpful in identifying things I can improve. I was happy with how few mistakes I had writing from memory and I'm eager to continue improving.
