		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 cup warm water</li>
			<li>3 tbsp warm milk</li>
			<li>2 tsp active dry yeast</li>
			<li> 2 1/2 tbsp sugar</li>
			<li>2 large eggs</li>
			<li>3 cups bread flour</li>
			<li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>

		<h2>Preparation:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Whisk together warm water, warm milk, yeast and sugar. Then, beat 1 egg.<br><br></li>
			<li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, add flours, salt and butter.<br>Using the paddle attachment, mix the ingredients until the butter is the size of crumbs.<br><br></li>
			<li>Stir in yeast mixture and beaten egg. Run the mixer on med-low until dough forms, about 5-8 mins.<br><br></li>
			<li>Scrape down the sides of the bowl, if necessary, and shape the dough into a ball.<br>Cover bowl with a damp kitchen towel and let the dough rise until doubled in size, about 1-3 hours at room temp.<br><br></li>
			<li>Line a baking sheet with parchment papter. Using a floured dough scraper, divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.<br><br></li>
			<li>To shape the dough into balls, gently flatten each piece like a pancake.<br>Gather the ends and pinch the dough to seal in the center.<br>Flip the dough over, cup the surface with your palm, and roll into a ball.<br>Transfer to baking sheet, placing them a few inches apart.<br>Cover and rest for 1-2 hours, or until puffy and slightly risen.<br><br></li>
			<li>To make the egg wash, beat the remaining egg with a splash of water.<br>When the buns are finished with the second rise, gently brush each one with egg wash.<br>At this point, you could add sesame seeds to the top of your rolls, if desired.<br><br></li>
			<li>Preheat oven to 400 F and place a skillet or baking dish at the bottom of the oven.<br>Before the dough goes in, add 1/2 cup of water to the skillet to create steam.<br>This will help keep the bread nice and moist.<br>Bake for about 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.<br>Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.<br></li>
